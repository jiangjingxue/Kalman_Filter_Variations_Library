# kalman_variants - a selective set of variants of nonlinear Kalman Filter


## Summary
`kalman_variants` implements several Kalman filter nonlinear variants and provides a a wealth of examples with a specific goal for educational purpose. Every single line of code is annotated in a detailed manner and the examples are developed with a thematic focus on state estimation applications for robot and autonomous systems. You also have `free access` to a beginner-friendly kalman filter implementation guide at https://github.com/jiangjingxue/kalman_filter_variants/doc/ to go along with the code to accelerate your learning.
